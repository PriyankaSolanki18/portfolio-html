<h1>The Best Movies According to Priyanka</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>Its a movie about 3 engineer friends, how they motivate each other to pursue their passion</p>
<p>This is my all time favourite, most recommended...so go and watch out now.</p>
<h3>Chichore</h3>
<p>This movie tells that the only thing matter is how much efforts we had put in things and think of the outcomes it brings. One should not consider themselves as a failure if they are not able to crack a task.</p>
<h3>Kutputli</h3>
<p>It is a thriller, suspense killer movie that doesn't let your eyes to blink.</p>
